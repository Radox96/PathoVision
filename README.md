# PathoVision

## What is PathoVision going to be you might ask...

The aim of the project is to develop a small phenotyping set-up for Arabidopsis thaliana plants to assess disease symptoms. We want it to be based on a Raspberry Pi with a camera and a plant-specific computer vision (CV) software. Finally we want to correlate occurring disease symptoms after bacterial infection with the respective bacterial titers within the plant.

With PathoVision we want to make Computer Vision analysis of disease symptoms available and easy to use for you.

PathoVision is a Python 2.7 based coding project that uses OpenCV [(2018)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and PlantCV [(2016)](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/master/LICENSE) for fast and effective analysis of for example:
- plant growth
- percentual size of lesions on leaves

and other features will be added along the way.

If you have any suggestions or ideas of your own, contribution to our project is highly welcome.
