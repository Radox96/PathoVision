# PathoCV

## What is PathoCV going to be you might ask...

With PathoCV we want to make Computer Vision analysis of ....... available and easy to use for you.

PatthoCV is a Python 2.7 based coding project that uses OpenCV [(2018)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and PlantCV [(2016)](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/master/LICENSE) for fast and effective analysis of for example:
- plant growth
- percentual size of lesions on leaves
