# PathoVision Roadmap

The aim of the project is to develop a small phenotyping set-up for Arabidopsis thaliana plants to assess disease symptoms. We want it to be based on a Raspberry Pi with a camera and a plant-specific computer vision (CV) software. Finally we want to correlate occurring disease symptoms after bacterial infection with the respective bacterial titers within the plant.

With PathoCV we want to make Computer Vision analysis of disease symptoms available and easy to use for you.

PathoCV is a Python 2.7 based coding project that uses OpenCV [(2018)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and PlantCV [(2016)](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/master/LICENSE) for fast and effective analysis of for example:
- plant growth
- percentual size of lesions on leaves

and other features will be added along the way.

If you have any suggestions or ideas of your own, contribution to our project is highly welcome.
### What has to be done?

Within this document you will find detailed milestones completed and still in progress as well as an overall outlook at what we want to achieve.


#### Milestone: Getting started
- Setting up GitHub repository and establish it on AWS Cloud9
- Installing all needed components for PlantCV [(2016)](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv/blob/master/LICENSE)
- Create Installation instructions for PlantCV on  AWS Cloud9

#### Milestone: First steps
- Analyse first Test images: lesion size in relation to leaf area
###### DEADLINE: 20.03.2018

#### Milestone: Taking it further
- Analyse multiple leaves in one image

###### Further milestones will be added along the road

---

### When dreams come true...
#### Outlook:
- Creating PathoCV Telegramm-bot running on eg.: a Raspberry Pi:
Idea: being able to send images to the bot and receiving the results almost instantly.
